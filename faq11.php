	Yes, it is possible to contact a member without posting it in the forums. <br />
	To send a private message to a member, you can click on their names at the posts. <br />
	It will lead you to their profiles. You will see a link called "send PM" and from there you can message that member. <br />
	A other option is to go to the memberlist, located on the red menubar, that also will lead you to their profiles. <br />
